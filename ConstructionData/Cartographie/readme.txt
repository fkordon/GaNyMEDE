This directory contents the structure of the course, described thanks to the following files:

- elements-cours.csv and elements-cours.xls: only elements-cours.csv is mandatory but you might find it easy to extract
  it from a traditional spreadsheet software. You can host several variants of your course (changing the order of
  sequences) but only the file "elements-cours.csv" is considered by the GaNyMEDE scripts

- contraintes.dot : you can add there some constraints to place your "course map" when it is generated (thanks to dot
  from GraphWiz, that must be installed).

- prologue.dot: this is a default file used by the generator. You may change it but it is really not necessary ;-)
