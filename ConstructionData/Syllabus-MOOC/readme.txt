For FUN (open eds), there should be the following files:

- syllabus.html: that describes the syllabus. e propose a typical content structure. Please do not remove the "section"
  tag that is used in the CSS apparently.

- configure-mooc.sh: that contains the global information to be used in the MOOC. This file is in fact a bash script
  for implementation convenience
