GeNeric Moocs  &amp; coursEs Development Environment


Directory content

ConstructionData: it contains the metadata for your course. At this stage, it contains a small
example

Scripts: it contains the scripts used to build
	- the map of the course
	- the companion web site
	- the archive to be deployed on France Université Numérique
	- and more later? ;-)

Website: the minimum files for the web site (others are generated)

Usage
=====

type "make" to discover the options of the Makefile.

Warnings
========

All of this is at a quite early stage, even if development started one year ago... a lot of modification was done
and there is a need for setting up a more proper version.

Sorry, most of it is still in french (procrastination and lack of time ;-)

PS: all of this was tested under a Mac under MacOS 10.9

PPS: at this stage, perl package Roman is required (http://search.cpan.org/~chorny/Roman-1.22/lib/Roman.pm)
